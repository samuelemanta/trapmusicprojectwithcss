        <h3>The Birth and Evolution of Trap Music: A Legacy Cemented by Iconic Albums</h3>
        <p>Trap music, an innovative subgenre of hip-hop, has evolved from its Southern roots into a worldwide cultural phenomenon. Characterized by its heavy 808 bass, rapid hi-hats, and introspective or braggadocious lyricism, trap has become a defining sound of contemporary music. Among the numerous contributions to the genre, five albums stand out as monumental achievements: Rodeo by Travis Scott, Jeffery by Young Thug, Die Lit by Playboi Carti, Luv Is Rage 2 by Lil Uzi Vert, and Monster by Future. These records not only epitomize the genre's creative heights but also serve as its most influential and enduring works.</p>
